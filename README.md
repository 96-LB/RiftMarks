# RiftMarks

This project is a mod for Rift of the NecroDancer which allows charters to add "riftmarks" to their custom levels to improve the quality of life in practice mode. A riftmark functions as a checkpoint in the song that can be used to mark important segments or chapters. Players with the mod installed can use the practice mode slider to quickly start the song from a riftmark without having to search for the exact beat. This makes it easier to quickly practice a particular segment or jump to a late point in a long song.
